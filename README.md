# JavaScript Quiz

## Description

The purpose of this assignment was to continue practicing JavaScript skills as well as new JavaScript skills, like using the DOM to dynamically update an application. 
I also applied new methods like setInterval() to create a timer. I also applied client-side storage knowledge using local storage methods like localStorage.setItem() and localStorage.getItem(). The former was used to save user data into local storage and the latter was used to retrieve user data from local storage. 
Over all, this was a challenging assignment, and I would like to reference my TA and tutor, Rene Trevino, in helping me to create and de-bug functions like the mcChecker(), saveScore() and viewHighScore() functions.
